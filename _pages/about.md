Hello! thanks for visiting.

I am an assistant professor (tenured) in the department of Electronics and Computer Engineering at the Institute of Engineering, Thapathali Campus. I have been associated with Thapathali Campus since 2018.

Recently, my research interests have shifted strongly towards exploring the use of deep learning and computer vision for vision-based autonomous navigation of micro-aerial vehicles. I am keen on experimenting with advanced vison sensors (event-based, RGB-D, ToF cameras, LiDAR) and developing algorithms that enable miniature unmanned aerial vehicles to reliably inspect challenging environments and physically interact with their surroundings.

For the past three and half years (2019 till present), I have been coordinating the M.Sc. in Informatics and Intelligent Systems Engineering (MSIISE) program at Thapathali Campus. Over the years, I have taught extensively at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Please visit the [teaching page](/teaching/) for an overview of the courses that I have taught along with their syllabi. Besides teaching, I have had the opportunity to supervise several master theses and bachelor projects. My growing collection of supervised theses/projects is accessible from the [supervised research page](/projects/).

Previously, my professional engagement included an approximate nine-month stint (2017 / 2018) as an assistant director at the [Nepal Telecommunications Authority](https://www.nta.gov.np/), where I was part of the frequency management section. Prior to my coroporate experience, I worked for approximaetely five years (2012 till 2017) as an adjunct lecturer in the department of Electronics and Computer Engineering at the Institue of Engineering, [Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/).
