Hello! thanks for visiting.

I am a tenured assistant professor in the department of Electronics and Computer Engineering at the Institute of Engineering, Thapathali Campus. I have been associated with Thapathali Campus since 2018.

Recently, my research interests have shifted strongly towards exploring the use of deep learning and computer vision for vision-based autonomous navigation of aerial robots. I am keen on experimenting with advanced vison sensors (event-based, RGB-D, LiDAR) for processing visual information on-board drones and have them steer themselves in unstructured and dynamic environments. I am also excited to explore foundation models for aerial exploration leveraging both visual perception and natural language instructions.

I initiated the M.Sc. in Informatics and Intelligent Systems Engineering (MSIISE) program at Thapathali Campus in 2020. I have been coordinating the MSIISE program for over four years now (2020 till present). Over the years, I have taught extensively at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Please visit the [teaching page](/teaching/) for an overview of the courses that I have taught along with their syllabi. Besides teaching, I have had the opportunity to supervise several master theses and bachelor projects. My growing collection of supervised theses/projects is accessible from the [supervised research page](/research/).

Previously, my professional engagement included an approximate nine-month stint (early to late 2018) as an assistant director at the [Nepal Telecommunications Authority](https://www.nta.gov.np/), where I was part of the frequency management section. Prior to my corporate experience, I worked for approximately five years (2012 till 2017) as an adjunct lecturer in the department of Electronics and Computer Engineering at the Institute of Engineering, [Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/).

Regarding my educational background, I received my Bachelor of Science in Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering from the [University of Minnesota, Duluth](https://www.d.umn.edu/) in 2008, Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) in 2009, and Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) in 2011.
